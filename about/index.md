OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week, or OSMGeoWeek for short, is an annual celebration of open mapping that takes place each November. OSM community members host in-person and virtual events to showcase the power of crowdsourced mapping and invite new mappers into the fold. This website is a central hub where people can post their events and discover events to attend.

## About [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us/)

OpenStreetMap US is a nonprofit membership organization advancing geospatial data democracy by catalyzing collaborative action between individuals, government agencies, nonprofits, corporations, and academia. OpenStreetMap US works to ensure that OpenStreetMap, the largest crowdsourced map of the world, is leveraged equitably through targeted education and outreach to incorporate individuals and communities under-represented in policymaking and technology circles into the open geospatial data movement. Through our grassroots initiatives and community-based programs, we create pathways for all individuals to access and improve OpenStreetMap as it increasingly becomes the source that decision-makers and corporations use to impact our lives.
