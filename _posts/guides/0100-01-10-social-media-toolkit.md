What is #OSMGeoWeek?
---------------------------------------------

OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week is a yearly tradition that coincides with Geography Awareness Week introduce and promote OpenStreetMap as a powerful tool for development and humanitarian related efforts. This week is an exciting show of force of the OpenStreetMap community that highlights its global reach and potential for positive impact, while being a great way to connect with local communities (including your own!) around the world.

Participants will be encouraged to contribute key open mapping data to a smaller number of highlighted projects focusing on development and humanitarian needs, or to organize a mapping event that suits their own data needs.

Topline Messages
----------------

-   OSM GeoWeek calls on teachers, students, community groups, governments, private sector and map lovers around the world to come together to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world.

-   Mapping is important for humanitarian and development efforts, not just in a disaster.

-   Mapathons are an effective way to enhance technical skills, identify ways to participate in the global mapping community, and develop sustainable linkages with development and humanitarian programs addressing challenges in their countries

-   Anyone with an internet connection can be a volunteer mapper in OpenStreetMap, and while local knowledge adds crucial context to the map, you do NOT need to be located in or have specific knowledge of the place you are mapping to be able to contribute.
