Ongoing collaboration by CartONG, Missing Maps, and MapGive, along with their communities of volunteers is supporting mapping of several refugee camps that are not mapped. Currently the organizations in charge of these camps do not have up-to-date maps on the areas in question to be able to provide humanitarian aid and ensure access to basic facilities. Once the remote mapping is completed in OpenStreetMap, the organizations in the field will add additional information about the infrastructure. Then updated maps will be created for refugee camp planning which will improve living conditions for the refugee communities.
