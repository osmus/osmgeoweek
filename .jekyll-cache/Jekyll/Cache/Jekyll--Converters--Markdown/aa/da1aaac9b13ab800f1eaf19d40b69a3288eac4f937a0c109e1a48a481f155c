<h1 id="some-important-ground-rules-and-tips">Some important ground rules and tips:</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Have fun! Weâ€™re here to develop a shared understanding of the geography, community mapping, and open data. Make friends!</li>
  <li>Ask for help, discuss how to map with your colleagues â€“ how should you represent whatâ€™s on the ground? Point? Line? Area? Strive for consensus and consult available resources.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Never, ever copy from Google</em></strong> (or any other proprietary data source). You may use Google (or Yahoo or Bing) to find a source web page, but Googleâ€™s terms &amp; conditions expressly forbid copying. Get your information from a <strong><em>primary source</em></strong> â€“ fieldwork or the target web site. We list some sources for you below.</li>
  <li>See Rule #3.</li>
  <li>DO NOT USE INTERNET EXPLORER. It will not work. However, Chrome and Firefox work fine.</li>
</ol>
